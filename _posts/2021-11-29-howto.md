<h1 style="text-align:center;"> How to add new blogs</h1>

## config
It is very important to set the <font color='red'>_config.yml</font> file. 

*Base URL*

The url part template is:
```
url:              'https://[username].github.io'
baseurl:          '/[your project name]'
```
FYI, empty baseurl is okay if you only use the gitbook locally. Otherwise the github pages will look different from your local one. 

Check this [blog](https://byparker.com/blog/2014/clearing-up-confusion-around-baseurl/) for more info.

*Other Settings*

Check the chinese version [config document](http://jekyllcn.com/docs/configuration/).

## posts 
The simplest method to create page is to add certain html(md) file under the root directory. 

The path of the file determines the associated URL.
```
.
├── about.md    # => http://example.com/about.html
├── index.html    # => http://example.com/
└── contact.html  # => http://example.com/contact.html
```
Complicated structure like subfolder is also supported. 
```
.
├── about.md          # => http://example.com/about.html
├── documentation     # folder containing pages
│   └── doc1.md       # => http://example.com/documentation/doc1.html
├── design            # folder containing pages
│   └── draft.md      # => http://example.com/design/draft.html
```

*Add Posts*

"The _posts folder is where your blog posts live. You typically write posts in Markdown, HTML is also supported."

To create a post, file need to follow the following format:
```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
```

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

```
2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md
```

## How to enable latex

Latex is required for some documentation, to enable latex, one need to add the following script at the beginning of the certain markdown file.

```javascript

    <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
        MathJax.Hub.Config({
            tex2jax: {
            skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre'],
            inlineMath: [['$','$']]
            }
        });
