Building a MSVC project with cmake is mostly the same as building a project on Linux, except for some extra settings.

1. Symbol visibility

    The deault behavior of MSVC compiler differs a lot: 
    ```
    By default No symbols are exported, except symbols explicitly 
    declared with * __declspec(dllexport).
    ```
    In MSVC project cMakeLists.txt
    ```
    set(CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS On)
    ```
    to set symbol export settings.
